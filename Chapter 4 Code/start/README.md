Currently using Bootstrap v4.0.0-alpha.4 (Sass version)

### What is JBST4?
JBST4 is a blank WordPress theme built with Bootstrap 4.

JBST4 is intended to be used as a starter theme, not as a parent or theme framework. In almost all instances we would recommend you just hack away and customise JBST4 itself.

### Getting Started With Gulp
- Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org).
- Install [bower](http://bower.io).
- Using the command line, navigate to your theme directory
- Run `npm install`
- Run `gulp` to confirm everything is working

## Masonry template
The Masonry template organizes your post into [Masonry](http://masonry.desandro.com/)-like columns with just CSS by wrapping them. 

## Offcanvas menu template
The Offcanvas menu temlate contains a toggleable off-canvas navigation menu for small viewports.

### CSS Only
